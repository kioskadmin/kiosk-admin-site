After starting the server, complete the one-time setup before anything else.

<Steps>

1. **Open the setup page**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/setup](http://localhost:3000/setup).

   This page is only accessible when no admin account exists. It is automatically disabled once setup is complete.

2. **Create the admin account**

   Enter a username, email address, and a strong password. This account has the **ADMIN** role — full control over all devices and settings.

3. **Log in**

   You'll be redirected to the login page. Sign in with the credentials you just created.

4. **Add your first device**

   From the dashboard, click **Add device**. You'll need:

   | Field | Description |
   |---|---|
   | Name | A friendly label shown in the dashboard |
   | IP address | Local IP (or hostname) where the device's REST API is reachable |
   | Provider | `Fully Kiosk Browser` or `FreeKiosk` |
   | Password / API key | The password set in Fully Kiosk settings, or the optional API key for FreeKiosk |

5. **Check the connection**

   The device card appears on the dashboard. If the device is online and reachable, its status (battery, screen state, current URL) populates within a few seconds.

</Steps>

## Adding more users

To add a second user (ADMIN or VIEWER), go to **Settings → Users** and use the invite form.

VIEWER accounts can see device status and take screenshots but cannot send commands or change settings.
